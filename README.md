# Word Counter

A modern, minimalist web-based word counter that supports English and Traditional Chinese. The page updates statistics in real time and estimates reading and speaking time. Statistics can be exported as a text file or PDF.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a web browser. Enter or paste text into the textarea. Select the desired language, and view the statistics below the text box. Use the **Clear** button to reset the input. Use **Export Text** to download a `.txt` file or **Export PDF** for a `.pdf` file containing the stats.
